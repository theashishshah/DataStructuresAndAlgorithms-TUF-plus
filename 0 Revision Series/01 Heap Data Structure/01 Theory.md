####  Full Binary Tree?
-> Every node either has 0 or 2 children.

```
    1                           
   / \                           
  2   3                              
 / \                              
4   5  
No❌  

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \ / \
4  5 6  7
yes✅
```

#### Complete binary tree
-> All levels must be filled except the last level, and the last level must be filled from left to right.


#### Degenerated or pathological Tree
-> A tree where each parent has only one child. (Linked list kinda structure)

#### Perfect binary tree
-> All internal levels are have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

#### Balanced binary tree
-> A tree where diff of left and right sub-tree of each node should not >1.

#### Almost complete Binary tree.
-> same as comlete binary tree.
